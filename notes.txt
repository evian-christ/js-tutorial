Things to learn in advance
- HTML: the object that javascript directly controls
- CSS

Things that JS can do:
- webpage scripting: DOM (to look up)
- server side scripting: node.js
- Adobe PDF ???
- Unity Game Engine

Javascript is made to dynamically control html and css.

You can also run JS scripts from developer tools in Chrome in Console tab

Calculations

Math.pow(3,2); is 3 with power of 2 which is 9
Math.round(10.6); is 11 which is 10.6 rounded
Math.ceil(10.2); is 11 which is 10.2 rounded up
Math.floor(10.7); is 10 which is 10.7 rounded down
Math.sqrt(9); is 3 which is square root of 9
Math.random(); returns random number between 0 and 1.0

typeof x return type of x

to include reverse comma in a string, use escape
'she's cute' (x)
'she\'s cute' (O)

"hello world".length return length of "hello world" which is 11

The difference between == and ===

alert(1 == '1')     // true
alert(1 === '1')    // false

== returns true for same value different type
=== returns true only for same value same type

if () {
    a
} else if () {
    b
} else {
    c
}

&& and ||

&& = and
|| = or
! = not

true and false are booleans but there are alternative to booleans.

if (1) // true
if (0) // false
if ('') // false
if (undefined) // false
var a;
if (a) // false
if (null) // false
if (NaN) // false


Loops

while (condition) {
    code to run over and over
}

for (initialising, condition, execution) {
    code to run over and over
}

break = stop the loop
continue = continue the loop (immediately) (code below continue is skipped)

Functions
