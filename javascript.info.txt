1. An Introduction to JavaScript

> What is JavaScript?
    JavaScript are usually run in the browser, by JavaScript engines.
    Different JS engines codenames:
        - V8: Chrome, Opera, Edge
        - SpiderMonkey: Firefox
        - "Chakra" for IE, "JavaScriptCore", "Nitro" and "SquirrelFish" for Safari, etc.

    Today, JS can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server.

> What can in-browser JS do?
    Modern JS is a safe programming language.
    It does not provide low-level access to memery or the CPU.

    JS's capability greatly depend on the environment it's running in.
    For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow JS to read/write arbitrary files,
    perform network requests etc.
    (which are tasks to be done by communicating with the server)

    in-browser JS can do:
        - Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
        - React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
        - Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (AJAX, COMET)
        - Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
        - Remember the data on teh client-side ("local storage").

    in-browser JS cannot do:
        - JS on a webpage may not read/write files on the hard disk, no direct access to OS functions.
        - Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other

2. Variables

    > variables are declared with 'let' statement.
        let message = "Hello";
    
    > declaring twice triggers an error.
        let message = "Hello";
        let message = "World";
        # SyntaxError: 'message' has already been declared

    > There are two limitations on variable names in JS:
        1. The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbol $ and _.
        2. The first character must not be a digit.

    > constants are declared with 'const' statement.
        const birthday = "22.12.1997";

    > constants cannot be reassigned.
        birthday = "01.01.2000"
        # error, can't reassign the constant!

3. Data Types

    > JavaScript is dynamically typed.
        let message = "hello";  # string
        message = 123;          # number

    <Number>
    > number type represents both integer and float.
    > some special numeric values: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.
        alert(1/0);         # Infinity
        alert(Infinity);    # Infinity
    > NaN represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined operation.
        alert("asdf"/2);    # NaN, such division is erroneous
        alert(NaN+1);       # NaN
